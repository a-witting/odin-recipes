      <p>This homemade pasta fagioli soup is a simple, comforting dish made with wholesome pantry and fresh ingredients. It features tender ditalini pasta, creamy Great Northern beans, and sliced zucchini in a savory vegetable broth base. The soup is seasoned with dried basil, oregano, and a touch of garlic for a warm, herby flavor. Diced tomatoes add depth, while a drizzle of olive oil ties everything together. Served with garlic-seasoned croutons for a bit of crunch, this easy, hearty soup is perfect for a cozy lunch or light dinner.</p>
